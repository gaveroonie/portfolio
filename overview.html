          <h2>Project brief</h2>
          <p>The overview page is the homepage of the event. Its purpose is to give the user an outline of what the event is about who is speaking and what they their presentations are about.</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>Must be easy to update and must be adaptable to cover the life span of an event eg before the event , during the event and also after the event for users looking at previous events section.</p>
          <h3>Links</h3>

          <h5>Research</h5>
          <p>Before starting to design I researched what we currently had, and where we could improve it. The first place to start is looking at the original overview page, This is the first page the user sees when looking at an event so is incredibly important to make a good first impression.<br>You can view the original site<a target="blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405080539/https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/digital-marketing-innovation-summit-melbourne-2017"> here</a></p>

            <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <h3>Internal Interviews</h3>
            <p>We have a custom made CMS that all our events sites are built on, This CMS would be rebuilt with the new event site.<br> I wanted to identify any problem areas that could be improved on, so set out some interviews with each department to see what they found easy and wanted to keep and what they found difficult, and if there is anything new that they wanted that currently isn’t available</p>
            <h3>Event organisers</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>There are too many entry fields, too many images to upload,Too many text fields (which results in all the text being copied form one event to the next)</li>
            <li>It takes too long to create an event from scratch and their are issues when cloning old events</li>
            <li>Multi track Agendas are confusing and difficult to make</li>
            <li>Colocated events are not possible to make</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Sales Team</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Buy Ticket button to be more prominent </li>
            <li>Make the price page easier to understand</li>
            <li>A way of promoting the Early bird prices</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>To define what type of sponsorship package a company has bought</li>
            <li>To make information on the website accurate as the current executive summary is wildly inaccurate and leads to sponsors being let down</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>More lead capture opportunities</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h2>Speaking to attendees</h2>
            <p>I went to one of our London Events and interviewed some of the attendees. What I wanted to find out is why people come to our events.What is most important thing that users look for on our site before they buy a ticket.</p>
            <h3>What do you hope to gain by coming to our event</h3>
            <p>When speaking to delegates two main reasons kept popping up,Firstly people come to learn from there peers, these are usually the speakers from well established successful businesses and to gain insights into how they handle the day to day problems that they are facing.
            Secondly to network with people in the similar situations</p>
            <h3>On the website rate these in order of importance (1 being the most important)</h3>
            <p>Results</p>
            <ul>
            <li>1st: Speakers</li>
            <li>2nd: Agenda</li>
            <li>3rd: Attendees</li>

          <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
          <p>Now that Ive interviewed staff and users as well as identifying any obvious UI problems it was time to come up with some solutions.</p>
          <h3>UI needs refreshing</h3>
          <p>The UI elements needed a refresh to be more inline with current standards, standard CTA buttons replaced the icons style buttons and a set colour was set across all events. (not the each division having its own colour palette.</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/UI1.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>The UI is inconsistent in shape colour and even text</p>
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/UI2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Setting a style guide to be consistent through out the site</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Too many images</h3>
          <p>Image backgrounds on every section of the overview page caused a  problems with legibility of any information on top of them and also initial loading time of site and someone had to source all these images as we had over 100 events per year and at least six images per event (not including the carousels) it all added up . The solution was to have one main header image the venue image would be pulled from google maps </p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/6bkrndimage.gif"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Six background images for each event was too much, This was built when parallax images were a big thing and they really went for it :)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/6bkrndimage2.gif"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Pretty simple remove some images and split sections with background colours. The venue image is pulled from google maps</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Speaker Cards</h3>
          <p>Speakers were listed as the most important thing that drove people to purchase a ticket to our events, The old site did list them above the fold but only by their company logo and job title, this seemed a little impersonal to the speakers and wasn’t immediately obvious they were speakers as we show sponsors by just a logo, so we and up with a site full of logos people become a bit impervious to. A speaker card with the photo was the solution to this. <a href="speaker.html">See speakers page </a> for a more in depth break down</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/speakercrd1.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Speaker cards don’t represent speakers well as they are just the logo, which seems more like a sponsor</p>
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/speakercrd2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Add a speaker photo displayed as well as the logo, this helps attendees recognise the actual speaker at the event</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Speaker Card Layout</h3>
          <p>The speaker section I would have liked to of shown twelve speakers but after speaking to the event organisers the number of speakers needed before making an event go live was nine. Understandably they didn't want to delay launching just so the formatting fitted neatly.<br>Nine isn't a number that splits very easily (without leaving an orphan speaker (single speaker on a line). Unlike twelve that can be split into rows of two, three, and four.<br>To overcome this issue I decided to put in eight speakers and a ninth that was only visible when there are 3 rows (The ninth speaker is always visible on the speakers page it is just the speaker preview section on the overview page that temporarily hides it).</p><br>
           <div class="halfwidthimg" style="vertical-align: top;">

            <hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Using eight speakers still leaves an uneven line when there are three speakers per row</p>

            <hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Skipping the row of three and jumping from a row of four to a row two makes the speaker card too wide.</p>

            <hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Introducing a speaker that is only visible in certain screen sizes on the speaker preview section, (this speaker is always visible on the actual speakers page it is just the speaker preview section where they are potentially hidden)</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
          <p>The original exec summary was manually built in pages then uploaded so was quite labour intensive so it would be uploaded once and never updated this led to it never really being accurate which led to sponsors being misled on attendee numbers. It was also not responsive which meant it had to be changed.</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg">
            <img src="images/overview/execsum1.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Too much time spent making something that isn’t even responsive</p>

          </div>
          <h3>Early Bird Countdown</h3>
          <p>a request from the sales department was to have a way of promoting the early bird tickets as these offer a 40% discount. The solution was to have a countdown section that gave a sense of urgency</p>

        <h3 class="light">Speaker section</h3>
        <p class="light">The speaker section was rated the most important thing when interviewing attendees</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Countdown</h3>
        <p class="light">This was a totally new section brought in to promote the early bird promotion, As we have events that run in the US and APAC we set a timezone to this in the CMS so it is accurate to the place of the event</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Why Attend</h3>
        <p class="light">This was the same as the old site but just striped back into an opening paragraph followed by bullet points, the why attend page was scraped as it was being copied and pasted from event to event.</p><br>
         <h3 class="light">Attendees</h3>
        <p class="light">Attendees section was added as it came up in the user interviews that it is something they look for. The attendee logo’s are white svg’s.</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Lead capture</h3>
        <p class="light">This was a totally new section used to help marketing with lead capture</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Previous event video</h3>
        <p class="light">This was a totally new section that used our vast video library of recorded events</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Sponsors</h3>
        <p class="light">Sponsor section is a bit of a necessary evil as in users aren't too interested in who sponsors an event however it does drive revenue so is still needed the sponsor type has been added along with an hierarchy of what sponsors are highest are positioned first</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Executive Summary</h3>
        <p class="light">This was a automated version of the original executive summary.</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">Venue</h3>
        <p class="light">This was automated when filling out the venue section of the CMS</p><br>
        <h3 class="light">the team</h3>
        <p class="light">This was a totally new section so that any users wanted to contact the correct person to do with their queary would know who to contact.</p><br>

          <h3>The trade off between single &amp; mass producing</h3>
          <p>
          I like my work to stand out and to be individual and eye catching, This works well if I were designing individual event sites but when deisgning for mass production any design features are repeated across all the sites.</p><p>So a unique design feature looks great on a single site goes from unique to repetitive very quickly, when you have  hundreds all looking the same.</p><p>EG. if I have a background image placed in a triangle it will look great for one event but when a user sees it on hundreds of events it becomes a repetitive and also quite restrictive when designing for.</p><p>Its a bit like trying to pick an outfit to wear or food to eat with out change for the next year, you’d pick something that was versatile and gave you as much freedom as possible.</p><p>Also any extra design elements that would need more sections in the CMS were to be avoided Eg. changing the colour of the header text would need an input</p><p>So any stand out design features were avoided, but more of a simple design where the image does more if the work ... if that makes sense</p><p>So with this in mind the concept that we went with was quite a plain header.

            <h5>Header Concepts</h5>
            <p>For my initial concepts I used an image from the original event site I didn't want the staff I was showing it to to get too caught up on the actual image being used.</p><p>The images are produced by our creative department or sometimes event organisers if they are feeling particularly creative :l  ,so the area where they go has to be quite robust <p>
            <h3>The trade off when designing for a template</h3>
            <p>
            There is a difference when designing for a single site and designing for a template to be used across many sites. Any quirky or distinctive design features that work to make a site unique are repeated across all the sites so these stand out features make them seem repetitive quickly.</p><p> Also we dont want the creative team to be constraint by the template (eg every design background having to fit into a diamond shape)Also we want to keep the building of the event site as simple as possible so want to avoid having text  or background colour options or any sort of multiple layered background images were avoided.</p><p>So although I think their were some more attractive concepts we went with a plain stripped back header with a angled cut off</p><br></br><br></br>
