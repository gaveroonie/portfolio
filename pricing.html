     			<h2>Project breif</h2>
     			<p>An easy way for users to see the difference between tickets options </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>Must clearly show the all ticket options and the benifits of each one<br>
          Must fit in with TITO capabilities the 3rd party company we use to process creditcards<br>
          Must be able to highlight 1 ticket “most popular”</p>
          <h3>Links</h3>
          <p><a rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" target="_blank" href="https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/summits">Calendar</a><br>
          Pick an event and view speakers page<br>
          <span class="imagedescription">(the further into the future an event the less likley there will be an current speakers)<span></p>
     			</div>
     			<div  class="mainbodytext">
     			<h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>
     			<p>The first thing that became apperent was the tickets model was pretty complicated. In fact after speaking to every department within the company, no body could correctly tell me the difference with out making at least one error, Except the sales department who dealt with people on the phone everyday going through the ticket options.<br>The sheer amount of different tickets was probly the biggest problem, but this was not somthing I could just go in and change, it would need management to buy in<br>
          I set out to analys all of the ticket options </p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Original Ticket Page</h3><img src="images/Price/OldPricePage.png">
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Tito Handling Payments</h3><p>We use a third party company called Tito to handle the payments for our tickets. A widget from tito is inserted into the pricing page so any changes will have to take this into account, Also anything after the user clicks continue is set by Tito so cant really be changed</p><br><h3>Payment Checkout</h3><img src="images/Price/OldPricePagePayment.png">
          </div>
          <h2>What are all of these tickets?</h2>
          <p>There are potentially six different ticket types for a single event, I wanted to give an easier breakdown of these tickets to see what they were made up. It turns out they are just different combinations of three different components</p>
          <h3>Components of a ticket</h3>
          <div class="fullwidthimg"><img src="images/Price/TicketComponents.png">
          </div>
          <div class="fullwidthimg"><img style="max-width: 500px;width: 100%;" src="images/Price/TicketBreakdown.png">
          </div>

          <h2>Analysis Polarisis</h2>
          <p>Whilst I waited for management to consider my ideas I went ahead and continued to see what a page with every ticket type would look like. This would also give them an idea of what a new ticket page would look like with six ticket types.<br>
          When there are too many options to choose from, it becomes difficult to process exactly what it is you want</p>
          <div class="fullwidthimg"><h3>Ticket cards</h3><img src="images/Price/AnalysisPolarisis.png"><h3>Ticket Table Comparison</h3>
          <img src="images/Price/AnalysisPolarisisTable.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Having 6 ticket types for a single event is overkill and leads to bottlenecks at the pricing page. The table does help to compare however it is still too complicated and trying to make it clear on mobile will be challenging</p></div>

          <h2>Reducing the amount of ticket options</h2>
          <p>I tried to make a proposal to reduce the amount of ticket types, So this could potentially make a huge positive difference and increase sales or have a huge negative impact and reduce the amount of sales, So a cautious approach was taken</p>
          <div class="fullwidthimg"><img src="images/Price/Proposal.png">
          </div>

          <h2>On Demand</h2>
          <p>On Demand is one of our other sites. We sell subscriptions to get access to our video library of all our event recordings and presentaions slides.<br>This is ticket is purely for people who cant make the event and want to buy the recorded presentations and slides of the event. Sales of these tickets were extremley rare</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><img src="images/Price/ODpass.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Make this ticket secondary to the other tickets, but still available from the pricing page</p></div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><img src="images/Price/ODpass2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Removing the OnDemand Card removes one of the pricing cards but still lets a user know that there is an option if they cant physically make the event</p></div>

          <h2>New Ticket Model</h2>
          <p>After a meeting with the sales dept and the company head we went forward with removing some of the less profitable and less popular tickets, It wasnt quite my propasal of totally removing the single event On Demand Pass, but was happy enough at getting the amount of tickets removed</p>
          <h3>New Ticket Components</h3>
          <div class="fullwidthimg"><img style="max-width: 500px;width: 100%;" src="images/Price/ProposalNew.png">
          </div>
        <div style="display:none">
          <h2>Schwarzenegger Vs Bono</h2>
          <p>I wanted to test how a large speaker name, job title & company sits next to the opposite a short name, job title and company. Enter Arnie & Bono</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Logo at the bottom</h3><img src="images/ArnieWrong.jpg"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>The Logo at the bottom of the card makes the size of the gap more noticable</p></div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Text Logo Sandwich</h3><img src="images/ArnieRight.jpg"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>The Logo being put between the text lets the space be spread more evenly</p></div>
