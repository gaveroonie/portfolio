     			<h2>Project brief</h2>
     			<p>An overview to the event, It should give the user an outline to what the event will contain</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>Must show details about speaker including name, job title, company & and speaker bio. Must use existing database of speaker images. Speaker images are generally pretty low quality and taken from LinkedIn.</p>
          <h3>Links</h3>
          <p><a rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" target="_blank" href="https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/summits">Calendar</a><br>
          Pick an event and view speakers page<br>

          <h2>Original Site</h2>
          <p>The first place to start is looking at the original overview page, This is the first page the user sees when looking at an event so is incredibly important to make a good first impression</p>

            <p>Why are we redesigning the event site</p>
            <h2>Stake Holders</h2>
            <p>The upper management and board members request for an update were</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Hasn’t been updated in 5 years so needs a refresh</li>
            <li>Needs to be easier to navigate</li>
            <li>Past events aren’t utilised enough</li>
            <li>The 2 other sites aren’t clearly linked (OnDemand and Channels)</li>
            <li>Making an event with showing only past speakers isn’t obvious they are previous speakers</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section" style="background-color: #f1f1f1;padding: 80px;width: 100%;margin-left: -80px;">
            <h2 style="font-size:34px;line-height:34px;margin-top: 0px;">Research Interviews</h2>
            <h2>Internal Interviews</h2>
            <p>We have a custom made CMS that all our events sites are built on, This CMS would be rebuilt with the new event site.<br> I wanted to identify any problem areas that could be improved on, so set out some interviews with each department to see what they found easy and wanted to keep and what they found difficult, and if there is anything new that they wanted that currently isnt available</p>
            <h2>Internal Interview Results</h2>
            <h3>Event organisers</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>There are too many entry fields, too many images to upload,Too many text fields (which results in all the text being copied form one event to the next)</li>
            <li>It takes too long to create an event from scratch and their are issues when cloning old events</li>
            <li>Multi track Agendas are confusing and difficult to make</li>
            <li>Colocated events are not possible to make</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Sales Team</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Buy Ticket button to be more prominent </li>
            <li>Make the price page easier to understand</li>
            <li>A way of promoting the Early bird prices</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>To define what type of sponsorship package a company has bought</li>
            <li>To make information on the website accurate as the current executive summary is wildly inaccurate and leads to sponsors being let down</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>More lead capture opportunities</li>
            </ul>
          
            <h2>Speaking to attendees</h2>
            <p>I went to one of our London Events and interviewed some of the attendees. What I wanted to find out is why people come to our events.What is most important thing that users look for on our site before they buy a ticket.</p>
            <h3>What do you hope to gain by coming to our event</h3>
            <p>When speaking to delegates two main reasons kept popping up,Firstly people come to learn from there peers, these are usually the speakers from well established successful businesses and to gain insights into how they handle the day to day problems that they are facing.
            Secondly to network with people in the similar situations</p>
            <h3>On the website rate these in order of importance (1 being the most important)</h3>
            <p>Results</p>
            <ul>
            <li>1st: Speakers</li>
            <li>2nd: Agenda</li>
            <li>3rd: Attendees</li>
            <li>4th: Venue</li>
            <li>5th: watching previous presentations</li>
            <li>6th: Ticket Discount</li>
            <li>7th: Sponsors</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>What to keep what get rid of</h2>
          <h3>Reducing pages</h3>
          <p>During the interview process the event organisers complained about having to input too much text, Certain pages were often just copied and pasted from previous events, so weren’t unique and if they weren’t being utilised properly are a waste of time and space</p>
          <h3>Why attend</h3>
          <p>The why attend page was a page that should have informed the user why they should attend the event, There was a brief why attend section on the overview page but the individual page was was supposed to be more in-depth.<br>This seems fairly straight forward but the event organisers weren’t experts in the area of the event they organised so these pages were often copied and pasted from each event of the same division. It was decided that this page should be removed
          </p>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The summary in the nav took the user the the executive summary section at the bottom of the overview page so it wasn’t necessary to keep in the nav</p>
         
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h2>Mapping out the site</h2><p>A site map of a standard event site, This allows stakeholders to see the new event site structure</p><img src="images/redesign/sitemap2.svg"></div>
