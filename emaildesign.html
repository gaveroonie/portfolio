     			<h2>Email Design is complicated</h2>
     			<p>When I worked as part of a web development team every so often marketing would swing by and ask one of the developers to help fix or even redesign a marketing email template, this was usually met with developers becoming very busy very suddenly,.<br>I never understood why they hated it soo much, and as it was a job that no developer really wanted I thought it would be a good place to start to learn to code.</p>

          <h3>What I found out very quickly</h3>
          <p>Email design uses the same (CSS &amp; html) code as a website but anything added since say the year 2000 hasnt quite made it to email, or at least not to all mail clients. Tables is the main technique used to layout the elements in an email. Tables havent been used in web design since the 2000’s.</p>

          <p class="qoute">"The phrase code like its 90’s is often thrown around when talking about email development."</p>

          <p>The difference between one mail client and another is vast, Apple mail clients are great and i think give you the most freedom, Microsoft Outlook is a thorn in any email developers side. I think they have improved alot but since emails need to work on older versions it is still a problem today.</p>

          <p>Its like the difference between producing somthing that works on a black and white TV a color TV & a HD state of the Art TV and trying to get somthing that looks great on all of them is very difficult.</p>

          <h3>Text &amp; Image</h3>
          <p>So Text and Images pretty simple stuff the ingrediants to any email. Now the problem arises when you try and mix the two. (but every email Ive seen has a text and header image I hear you cry) What you are more than likley seeing is a header banner created in photoshop with text logo ect all added and flattened into a png.</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Image Header</h3><img src="images/email/email.gif"><p class="imagedescription">Here the header image is a single image with a width set to 100% so it fills the full width of the email, This is the most common way of making a header</p>
          </div>
         <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Image with live text </h3><img src="images/email/email2.gif"><p class="imagedescription">Here we have the image and text as seperate assets so they can rezize indervidually</p>
          </div>

          <div style="background-color: #f1f1f1;padding: 80px;width: 100%;margin-left: -80px;">
            <h2 style="font-size:34px;line-height:34px;margin-top: 0px;">Solutions</h2>
            <h2>Layout</h2>
            <p>Having the tickets laid out vertically in a table makes it difficult to compare as you have to constantly move keep reading back and forth between new lines</p><p>Making a comparison table makes it a lot easier to compare</p>
            <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Ticket Cards</h3><img src="images/Price/Layout1.png"><p>Cards improve the ability to scan across but work best when there is three or four, when there is six its a little more difficult</p>
            </div>
            <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Comparison Table</h3><img src="images/Price/Layout2.png"><p>Comparison table really helps when there is a lot of different points to compare, but is overkill if there are only two or three points to compare.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Salesy descriptions</h2>
            <p>Looking at the descriptions for each ticket I feel that they can be simplified, there are points on the tickets that can be combined or totally removed</p>
            <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Original descriptions</h3><img src="images/Price/Sale1.png">
            </div>
            <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>shortened descriptions</h3><img src="images/Price/Sale2.png">
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Lo Fi Concepts</h2>
          <p>I felt I had done enough research on the shortcomings of the old page that I could start coming up with some solutions for the new price page, if there was going to be a reduction in the amount of tickets was still up in the air, so I proceeded as if we were keeping all of the tickets.</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Table concept</h3><img src="images/Price/Lofi1.png">
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>shortened descriptions</h3><img src="images/Price/Lofi2.png">
          </div>

          <h2>Not all cards are equal</h2>
          <p>I wanted to explore my options on what I could do with the ticket cards, So after speaking to the sales team I found that the lowest sales were OnDemand and 1 day passes and they were both in single figures for the year, The top revenue was made off of three main tickets Silver, Gold and Diamond</p>

          <h2>On Demand</h2>
          <p>On Demand is one of our other sites, where we sell subscriptions to get access to our video library of all our event recordings and presentation slides.<br>This is ticket is purely for people who can't make the event and want to buy the recorded presentations and slides of the event. Sales of these tickets were extremely low.<br></p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>On Demand Card</h3><img style="max-width: 200px;width: 100%;" src="images/Price/ODpass.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;max-width: 200px;margin-left: 0;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect" style="max-width: 200px;margin-left: 0;"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>Make this ticket secondary to the other tickets, but still available from the pricing page.</p></div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Replacing with a link</h3><img src="images/Price/ODpass2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Removing the On Demand Card removes one of the pricing cards but still lets a user know that there is an option if they can't physically make the event.</p></div>

          <h2>1 Day Pass</h2>
          <p>So the one day pass is identical to the silver pass except for it only gives access to one day of the event, after this pass is selected Tito allowed the sales team to put add ons to that pass that are equal to a one day pass for every ticket type.</p>
          <h3>New Ticket Components</h3>
          <div class="halfwidthimg" style="width:25%"><img style="max-width: 500px;width: 100%;" src="images/Price/OneDay1.png"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>The one day pass takes up a ticket card and space on the table but is the same as a one day silver pass.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg" style="width:60%"><img style="max-width: 500px;width: 100%;" src="images/Price/OneDay2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>Adding the one day pass as a secondary option to a the other tickets means it doesn't need a separate card, or to go onto the table.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Analysis Paralysis</h2>
          <p>Whilst I waited for management to consider my ideas about reducing the amount of tickets I went ahead and continued to see what a page with every ticket type would look like. Firstly without any of the recent changes, then with the changes<br>
          When there are too many options to choose from, it becomes difficult to process exactly what it is you want.</p>
          <div class="halfwidthimg" ><img src="images/Price/HiFi1.png"><hr style="background-color:#888888;"></hr><p class="imagedescription"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">It's OK but could be better<br></span>So this is a single track event (so no AAA pass) here is all the ticket options displayed equally, Its definitely easier to compare than the original</p>
          </div>
          <div class="halfwidthimg" ><img src="images/Price/HiFi2.png"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>This is the mock up with the three main ticket types displayed prominently and the other 2 still available but less prominent</p>

      <p>After making the high fidelity concepts I was lucky enough to have a developer, code a working prototype, the complexity of the different tracks was too much to build in a prototyping application like UXPin or invision.</p>
