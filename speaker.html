   			<h2>Project breif</h2>
   			<p>A page to view what speakers are speaking at the event</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Must show details about speaker including name, job title, company & and speaker bio. Must use existing data base of speaker images. Speaker images are generaly pretty low quality and taken from LinkedIn</p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p><a rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" target="_blank" href="https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/summits">Calendar</a><br>
        Pick an event and view speakers page<br>
        <span class="imagedescription">(the further into the future an event the less likley there will be an current speakers)<span></p>
   			</div>
   			<div  class="mainbodytext">
   			<h2>Speaker cards</h2>
   			<p>Speaker card requirements were to include photo and logo. Putting these two elements together on a single card always made the card look crowded, but the displaying the logo was the easiest way to advertise if a speaker came from a recognisable company, which was a huge selling point for our events</p>
        <h3>Cards Low fidelity</h3>
        <div class="halfwidthimg" style="max-width:200px;"><img src="images/SpkrCardWireframe1.jpg"><p class="imagedescription">The logo along with the speaker photo never really sat well with me but was a necessity to advertise the big named companies, and originally we only displayed the logo which felt a bit inpersonal, so was a huge improvement on what we had. </p></div>
        <div class="halfwidthimg"  style="max-width:200px;"><img src="images/SpkrCardWireframe2.jpg"><p class="imagedescription">Without the logo the card is definately alot cleaner, but the breif required the logo</p></div>
        <h2>Speaker Modal or speaker page</h2>
        <p>There are benifits and disadvantages for both. A full page doesnt limit the amount of imformation shown however it does take the user away from the other speakers. The modal keeps the user on the event speakers page</p>
        <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Modal</h3><img src="images/SpkrCardModal.jpg"><p class="imagedescription">The modal design let users switch between speakers easily but did limit the amount of information shown</p></div>

        <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Full Page</h3><img src="images/SpkrCardPage.jpg"><p class="imagedescription">An Indervidual page for each speaker worked well for displaying more information about the speaker eg there presentation bio, however somtimes speaker do multiple presentaions and could get confusing</p></div>
        <h2>Meet the zuckerbergs</h2>
        <p>I moved onto to hi fideltity speaker card concepts, Using the Mark Zuckerberg as a test (he wasnt ever really coming to speak at one of out events)</p>
        <div class="fullwidthimg"><img src="images/Zuckerbergs.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Schwarzenegger Test</h2>
        <p>Speaker names vary in length from very short to extremley long, the longest name that comes to mind is..... Schwarzenegger. So the top 3 concepts had the Schwarzenegger test how do they handle really long names</p>
        <div class="fullwidthimg"><img src="images/Schwarzenegger.jpg"><p class="imagedescription">Speaker names vary in length from very short to extremley long, the longest name that comes to mind is..... Schwarzenegger. So every concept had the Schwarzenegger test how do they handle really long names</p></div>
        <h2>Schwarzenegger Vs Bono</h2>
        <p>I wanted to test how a large speaker name, job title & company sits next to the opposite a short name, job title and company. Enter Arnie & Bono</p>
        <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Logo at the bottom</h3><img src="images/ArnieWrong.jpg"><hr style="background-color:#dd3907;"></hr><p class="imagedescription incorrect"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Problem<br></span>The Logo at the bottom of the card makes the size of the gap more noticable</p></div>
        <div class="halfwidthimg"><h3>Text Logo Sandwich</h3><img src="images/ArnieRight.jpg"><hr style="background-color:#80b91e;"></hr><p class="imagedescription correct"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"> Solution<br></span>The Logo being put between the text lets the space be spread more evenly</p></div>
